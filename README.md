# Animal Aggregator

Collect all the animals and bring them home!

# Theme - Combine

Emulate cherry powerup in Mario ---

Start controlling a single animal, when you tag other animals you control them as well (naively).

Objective is to get animals to a goal.

Challange from figuring out which animals to collect first given the pitfalls.

# Development

Fast iteration
* Run `cargo watch -x 'run'` to watch for asset changes
* Export .gltf file from Blender using custom keyboard shortcut (right-click on export option)
* Attach extra behaviours to existing scene elements, make use of labels in blender to dictate behaviour from blender files.
